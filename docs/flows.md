# Flows

Documents the state machines, screen states, and transition logic for the TUI.

---

## Overview

### With `-f <path>` (Explicit File)

```text
-f given
├── path is a directory          → hard exit: "path is a directory, expected a file"
├── file does not exist          → hard exit: "file not found: <path>"
├── file fails Parse()           → hard exit: "invalid compose file: <error>"
└── valid                        → dashboard
```

Hard exits happen in `cmd/root.go` before the TUI is initialised.

### Without `-f` (File Discovery)

```text
no -f
└── ScanAll(CWD) + Parse() each candidate
    ├── 0 valid files            → Watching screen (cold start)
    ├── 1 valid file             → dashboard
    └── 2+ valid files           → Project Selector → dashboard
```

Validity requires both conditions: file exists on disk **and** parses as valid compose YAML.

### Runtime: file disappears (Disconnected)

```text
dashboard → watched file deleted or moved
└── Watching screen ("disconnected — waiting for <filename>")
    └── watches for the SAME filename to reappear
        └── file reappears + valid   → dashboard
```

### Watching screen: file appears (cold start)

```text
fsnotify event (create/write in CWD)
└── re-run ScanAll() + Parse()
    ├── 0 valid  → stay on Watching screen
    ├── 1 valid  → dashboard
    └── 2+ valid → Project Selector → dashboard
```

---

## Watcher Lifetime

The watcher is created at app startup and runs for the entire process lifetime — including while the dashboard is
active. `app.Init()` starts `watcher.Next()` and the app re-subscribes after every `FileAvailabilityChanged` by
returning another `watcher.Next()` Cmd from `Update`. The active sub-model (startup flow or dashboard) receives the
message via `app.Update`'s dispatch logic.

---

## Watcher Edge Case Behaviour

The watcher (`internal/services/watcher`) handles several edge cases in its event loop:

| Behaviour | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `Chmod` events filtered | `Chmod` events are ignored and do not trigger a scan |
| Unknown filenames filtered | Events for files not in the known filename set are ignored |
| Errors on errors channel | Logged at `slog.Warn` level; event processing continues unaffected |
| `Close()` idempotency | Multiple `Close()` calls return `nil` after the first; `Next()` returns `nil` once closed |
| Channel closure on events channel | The goroutine exits and the underlying fsnotify watcher is closed |
| Extra file events with absent file | When an extra (non-known) file is monitored and the event fires but the file does not exist on disk, `Files` in the emitted message is empty |

See `internal/services/watcher/service_test.go` for test coverage of each case.

---

## Root Orchestrator (`internal/app/app.go`)

The app manages three phases plus a cross-phase About overlay:

```text
appStartup    — startup flow is the active sub-model
appDashboard  — dashboard flow is active (post-ProjectLoaded)
appWatching   — watching flow is active (disconnected, waiting for file to reappear)
```

The About overlay is a cross-phase UI layer that can be opened from any phase via F1 or
brand-click; it is rendered on top of the current view using the compositor. While the overlay
is open, phase-specific input is blocked. Close keys: F1, esc, q (q does not quit when about
is open).

### Init (two Cmds in parallel)

```text
app.Init()
├── watcher.Next()                → begins perpetual watcher subscription
└── startup.Init() (or direct)    → kicks off scan (or immediate parse for -f case)
```

If `-f` was given (already validated in `cmd/root.go`), the initial scan is skipped and the startup flow receives the
path directly.

### Message dispatch

```text
app.Update(msg)
├── msgs.ProjectLoaded           → transition startup → dashboard
├── msgs.FileAvailabilityChanged → re-subscribe watcher, dispatch to startup or dashboard
├── tea.WindowSizeMsg            → forward to active sub-model
├── theme.Changed                → update pointer, forward to active sub-model
├── msgs.SettingsApplied         → update config, forward to dashboard
├── tea.KeyPressMsg              → handleKeyPress (help toggle ?, about overlay F1/esc/q, quit, profile)
├── tea.MouseClickMsg            → handleMouseClick (brand zone → about overlay)
├── msgs.AboutVisibilityChanged  → track showingAbout flag
└── other msgs                   → forward to active sub-model
```

---

## Startup Flow (`internal/ui/flows/startup`)

A simple model (82 lines, no State pattern). Key behaviour:

- On `msgs.FileSelected`: parse the selected file, emit `msgs.ProjectLoaded`
- On `tea.WindowSizeMsg`: forward to fileSelect sub-model
- All other messages: forward to fileSelect sub-model

The startup flow does not own scan/parse logic — those happen via `scanner.ScanAll()` and `parser.Parse()` in the
watching/fileselect components before a `FileSelected` msg reaches this flow.

---

## Watching View (`internal/ui/components/watching`)

Rendered by the app's `appWatching` phase. Also used when the dashboard transitions to the Disconnected state (file
disappeared at runtime).

```text
stateIdle        — compose file unavailable, waiting for it to reappear
stateParseError  — file exists but failed to parse, showing error inline
```

### Cold start vs. Disconnected

The watching view accepts a mode that controls the message shown:

| Mode           | Heading                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `cold`         | Watching for a compose file…              |
| `disconnected` | Disconnected — waiting for `<filename>`   |

In disconnected mode, `FileAvailabilityChanged` is only acted on if the specific filename that was being monitored is
present in `Files`.

---

## Fileselect View (`internal/ui/components/fileselect`)

Rendered by the startup flow in the `Selecting` state (Project Selector).

```text
fileselectBrowsing  — list of valid files, cursor navigating
fileselectError     — Parse failed for the confirmed selection
                      (file was valid at list time, broken by the time Parse ran)
                      inline notice beneath the list; list remains active
```

On a new `FileAvailabilityChanged` the list is refreshed. If the previously errored file is no longer present, the error
notice is cleared.

---

## Dashboard (`internal/ui/flows/dashboard`)

Entered after `app` receives `ProjectLoaded{Project}`.

The dashboard is a flat model (no sub-states). It:

- Dispatches `StatePollTick` to the service panel and emits a `docker.Ps()` Cmd
- Routes `ServiceStop/Start/Restart/Rebuild/ActionCompleted` to `handleServiceAction`
- Handles `FileAvailabilityChanged` — if the project file is still present, re-parses and updates; if absent, sends a
msg that triggers `app` to transition to `appWatching`
- Forwards all messages to its sub-models (accordion, carousel, panel, settings)
- Toggles settings overlay via `SettingsVisibilityChanged`

## Message Types (`internal/msgs`)

## Topbar Daemon Lifecycle (`internal/ui/components/topbar`)

The topbar manages a daemon connectivity state machine with three states and a grace period / retry loop:

```text
Connecting (initial)
├── DaemonConnected         → Connected (clear retry, start health polling)
└── DaemonGraceExpired      → Unavailable (set retry deadline = now + 10s, start 1s tick)
    └── DaemonTick (each 1s)
        ├── IsRetryDue      → Connecting (clear retry, fire docker.Connect)
        └── not due         → daemonTickCmd (continue 1s tick)

Connected
├── DaemonUnavailable       → Unavailable (set retry deadline = now + 10s, start 1s tick)
└── DaemonPoll (each 2s)    → docker.Connect (health check)

Unavailable
├── DaemonTick (each 1s)
│   ├── IsRetryDue          → Connecting (fire docker.Connect)
│   └── not due             → daemonTickCmd (continue 1s tick)
├── DaemonConnected         → Connected (clear retry, start health polling)
└── DaemonUnavailable       → update retry deadline (idempotent)
```

Key behaviours:
- Grace period: 10 seconds from `Init()`; if no `DaemonConnected` arrives in that window, transitions to Unavailable
- Retry: every 1 second after entering Unavailable; retry interval is 10 seconds (configurable via `connection.RetryInterval`)
- Health polling: every 2 seconds when Connected; fires `DaemonPoll` which triggers `docker.Connect()` as a health check
- The topbar renders the daemon status (Connecting/Connected/Unavailable) in the top-right of the application frame
- The retry countdown is rendered by the topbar, not the Service Inspector

## About Overlay

The About overlay shows version information, ASCII art, and a GitHub URL. It is a
cross-phase UI layer — accessible from any phase (startup, dashboard, or watching).

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `F1`    | Open / Close the About overlay |
| Brand click (mouse) | Open the About overlay |
| `esc` or `q` | Close the About overlay (q does not quit when about is open) |

The overlay is rendered using the compositor on top of the current view. While the
overlay is open, phase-specific key handling is blocked. The overlay is implemented
in `internal/ui/components/about/`.

## Help Toggle

The help bar supports two modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Compact (default) | Shows up to 5 essential key bindings in a single line |
| Full | Shows organised columns of all available key bindings |

Press `?` to toggle between compact and full help. The toggle is handled at the app
level before any phase sees the key press. The help bar is implemented in
`internal/ui/components/helpbar/`.

## Runtime: file disappears (full trace)

```text
dashboard (appDashboard)
└── FileAvailabilityChanged{Files} where project file ∉ Files
    └── app → appWatching
        └── watching view (disconnected mode)
            └── watches for the SAME filename to reappear
                └── file reappears + valid → Parsing → appDashboard
```
