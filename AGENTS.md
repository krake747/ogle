# Agent Instructions

ogle — A terminal UI for observing and operating Docker Compose projects, no setup required.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make generate` | Regenerate mockery mocks |
| `make test` | Run tests with race detector |
| `make lint` | `go vet ./...` + `golangci-lint run ./...` |
| `make build` | Build to `./bin/ogle` |

## Agent workflow

- After writing files, run `make lint` before finishing. Run `make test` when feasible.
- If files were written, provide a commit message inline when finishing the task (but do not commit unless asked).

## Progressive disclosure

For deeper context the agent can pull on demand:

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues tracked on GitHub Issues via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical role labels: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context repo. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
