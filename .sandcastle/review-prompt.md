# TASK

Review the code changes on branch `{{BRANCH}}` and improve code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality.

# CONTEXT

## Branch diff

!`git diff {{SOURCE_BRANCH}}...{{BRANCH}}`

## Commits on this branch

!`git log {{SOURCE_BRANCH}}..{{BRANCH}} --oneline`

# REVIEW PROCESS

1. **Understand the change**: Read the diff and commits above to understand the intent.

2. **Analyze for improvements**: Look for opportunities to:
   - Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
   - Eliminate redundant code and abstractions
   - Improve readability through clear variable and function names
   - Consolidate related logic
   - Remove unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
   - Choose clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better than overly compact code

3. **Check correctness**:
   - Does the implementation match the intent? Are edge cases handled?
   - Are new/changed behaviours covered by tests?
   - Are errors properly wrapped with context (`fmt.Errorf("…: %w", err)`)? Use `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for unwrapping.
   - Are imports in the correct order: stdlib → third-party → `github.com/ma-tf/ogle`?
   - Are there package-level globals that should be constructor parameters? (Only `cmd/root.go` is exempt.)
   - Does the change introduce injection vulnerabilities, credential leaks, or other security issues?
   - Is `log/slog` used instead of the `log` package? No global loggers.

4. **Maintain balance**: Avoid over-simplification that could:
   - Reduce code clarity or maintainability
   - Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
   - Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
   - Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
   - Make the code harder to debug or extend

5. **Apply project standards**: Follow the coding standards defined in @.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md and docs/CONVENTIONS.md. The linter configuration in `.golangci.yml` enforces formatting automatically.

6. **Preserve functionality**: Never change what the code does - only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

# EXECUTION

If you find improvements to make:

1. Make the changes directly on this branch
2. Run `make tools` to install linting tools, then run `make` to ensure nothing is broken
3. Commit describing the refinements

If the code is already clean and well-structured, do nothing.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
